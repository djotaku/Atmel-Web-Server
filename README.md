Atmel-Web-Server
================

Here is our final project for the class â€“ a web server on an Atmel Mega32!!

Project report can be found at: http://server.ericsbinaryworld.com/gpl_code/server/webserver.pdf

This was based off of a lab I did with a partner as part of undergraduate work. I don't intend to do any more work on this, but I wanted the file to be out here in Github.
